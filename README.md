# jsonforms
## Experiments with Django forms

Snippets demonstrating joint usage of django-crispy-forms with their layouts (tabs, fieldsets, columns), django-select2-forms
with their pretty choice fields, django-jsonfield with its jsonfield (really?). Main idea is to create custom forms with
dynamically added fields, values from each field are saved to the jsonfield of the model according to the field name.
